Quick start

SAP is written as a single header file for easy inclusion in projects.

Add this single file :file:`sap.h` to your project include directory, and
add

::

	#include "sap.h"

to your main program. If you cloned the repository, it is located in the
:file:`include/` directory.

Example
=======

An example of a simple program made using SAP can be found in
`the repository
<https://github.com/chuahou/sap/blob/master/example/src/example.cpp>`_.

A more detailed tutorial is on the todo list.
