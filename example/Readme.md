# Example application using SAP

This is a sample application using the SAP header. It is a simple barebones
calculator that calculates the result of a binary operation (only +, -, *, /, %
and ^ are implemented), and can either handle integers or floats depending on
the flags given.

This is by no means a good application, or a sensible way to implement a
calculator, but it demonstrates the 3 types of arguments in SAP.
